# OpenSketch - Alan Pham's 15112 Term Project
Project Title: *OpenSketch*

Description: OpenSketch is a digital canvas where users can make their ideas come to life via drawing. The users 
will be able to use a variety of writing utensils including pens, pencils, and highlighters with customizeable features 
like size, color, etc. The highlighted features of the app are the lasso mode and shape autocorrect mode. When the lasso mode is activated, 
the user should be able to group any drawings or writing that they have already made and move it around the canvas and change its color properties. 
When the shape autocorrect mode is enabled, it should properly detect what kind of polygon the user is trying to draw and redraw a perfect polygon around 
the same size and area that the user orginially intended.

While those are the two core features that will be the highlight of the app, I would like to incoporate other useful features into the app. For instance, 
a page mode that allows the user to choose to whether they want to draw on a blank, lined, or graph paper; a preloaded shape tool that helps users draw perfect 
regular polygons; and an undo and reset button.
