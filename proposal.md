Alan Pham's FY Fall CMU 15112 Term Project 

Project Title: **OpenSketch**

Description: 

OpenSketch is a digital canvas where users can make their ideas come to life via drawing. The users will be able to use a variety of writing utensils including pens, pencils, and brushes with customizeable features like size, color, and opacity. The highlighted features of the app are the lasso mode and shape autocorrect mode. When the lasso mode is activated, the user should be able to group any drawings or writing that they have already made and move it, resize it, rotate it, or change certain properties. When the shape autocorrect mode is enabled, it should properly detect what kind of polygon the user is trying to draw and redraw a perfect polygon around the same size and area that the user orginially intended. 

While those are the two core features that will be the highlight of the app, I would like to incoporate other useful features into the app. For instance, a page mode that allows the user to choose to whether they want to draw on a blank, lined, or graph paper; a shape and ruler tool that helps users draw perfect shapes and lines; and an organized filing system so that users can save and organize their drawings or notes.

Verison Control / Backup Plan: My primary plan for version control and backing up my code will be through my personal github repository named 'alan-15112 TP'. Everytime I edit or make changes to my project, I will do it on a separate branch. When I am done with my session of coding, I will commit my code and perform a pull request to bring my changes back into the main branch. My secondary plan will be to keep an extra copy of my code uploaded in my CMU google drive.
