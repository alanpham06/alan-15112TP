# Writing Tool Icons Via Meta AI
I utilized Meta AI in order to generate all of the writing tool icons. The images will be used in the tool bar so that users know which button
they are pressing. 

| Writing Tool | Meta AI Prompt For Image Generation |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Pencil | "Draw a pencil icon for a note taking app" |
| Pen | "Draw a pen icon for a note taking app" |
| Highlighter | "Draw a highlighter icon for a note taking app" |
| Eraser | "Draw an eraser icon for a note taking app" |
| Ruler | "Draw a ruler icon for a note taking app" |
| Lasso Mode | "Draw a lasso icon for a note taking app" |
| Pre-Loaded Shapes Mode | "Draw a shapes icon for a note taking app" |
| Shape Autocorrect Mode | "Draw a line almosting finishing a square icon for a note taking app" |
